# marked

It forked from [chjj/marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) and I added TeX syntax support.

## TeX Syntax

You can use `$...$` for inline statements or `$...$` for block. 

For example：

**inline**

```
$a = b + c$
```

**block**

```
$$
s = \sum_{i=1}^{100}i
$$
```

## Options

**tex**

Type: `boolean`

Enable tex.
